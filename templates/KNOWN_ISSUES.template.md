## Issue Management

### Adding New Issues
1. Determine severity (Blocking → Low)
2. Add to appropriate section
3. Include all relevant fields
4. Link to sessions, code, decisions
5. Update status counts at top

### Resolving Issues
1. Verify fix in multiple scenarios
2. Add tests to prevent regression
3. Move to "Recently Fixed" section
4. Update status counts
5. Document in SESSIONS.md

### Prioritization
**Severity levels:**
- **Blocking:** Fix immediately, blocks deployment
- **High:** Fix soon, significantly impacts users/devs
- **Medium:** Fix when possible, has workarounds
- **Low:** Fix if time allows, minimal impact

**Priority factors:**
- User impact (how many affected, how severely)
- Workaround availability (none = higher priority)
- Data loss risk (potential = highest priority)
- Development friction (slows team = higher)

### Review Schedule
- **Weekly:** Review blocking/high issues
- **Monthly:** Review all issues, update priorities
- **Quarterly:** Prune fixed issues, reassess debt

## Notes

- This document should be brutally honest
- Hidden issues compound and get worse
- Document the "why" behind weird code
- Temporary hacks should be marked as technical debt
- If something feels wrong, document it
- Future you will thank present you
