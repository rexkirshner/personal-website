# My Running Journey

In November 2016, as I was packing up to head home from work, I downloaded Couch to 5K and resolved to get started that night.

Six months later I'd lost 100 pounds and finished a half marathon.

Six months after that, I ran the New York Marathon in 3:35.

These days I make a point of running long distances wherever I am. I've experienced everywhere in a completely new way. Each mile tells a story.

Since that first run in 2016, I've logged thousands of miles across 42+ countries.
