## Current Phase

**Phase:** Maintenance / Active Development
**Started:** Ongoing
**Target:** N/A (personal project, continuous updates)

**Focus:** Content updates and occasional feature additions. ACS now provides session continuity.

## Active Tasks

**In Progress:**
- [ ] None currently

**Completed Recently:**
- [x] Installed AI Context System v4.0.2
- [x] Ran /migrate-context for mature project setup
- [x] Migrated tasks/todo.md content to DECISIONS.md and SESSIONS.md
- [x] Added D006 (Performance Optimization) to DECISIONS.md
- [x] Added Session 0 (pre-ACS historical work) to SESSIONS.md
- [x] Created 14 detailed feedback entries for ACS improvement
- [x] Completed first /save-full execution
- [x] Committed all changes (3 commits ready to push)

**Next Up:**
- [ ] Push 3 commits to origin
- [ ] Consider running /code-review for site audit
- [ ] Use /save for quick updates at end of future sessions

## Blockers & Decisions

**Current Blockers:**
- None

**Recent Decisions:**
- **Keep CLAUDE.md at root:** Auto-loaded by Claude Code, serves as primary reference (D005)
- **Migrate tasks/todo.md content:** Extract decisions to DECISIONS.md, history to SESSIONS.md (D006)
- **Supplement don't replace:** ACS adds session state layer without duplicating CLAUDE.md

**Pending Decisions:**
- None

## Work In Progress

**Current Files:**
- N/A (documentation/setup session complete)

**Mental Model:**
ACS provides two-layer documentation:
1. **Static layer** (CONTEXT.md, DECISIONS.md) - Project orientation, rarely changes
2. **Dynamic layer** (STATUS.md, SESSIONS.md) - Session state, updated frequently

For this project, CLAUDE.md is the comprehensive static reference. ACS supplements it.

**Next Specific Action:**
Push the 3 commits to origin, then use /save at end of future sessions.

## Recent Accomplishments
