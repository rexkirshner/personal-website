## Blockers & Decisions

**Current Blockers:**
- None

**Recent Decisions:**
- **Installed ACS:** Added AI Context System for session continuity across weeks/months between work sessions
- **Keep CLAUDE.md:** Existing CLAUDE.md is comprehensive - ACS supplements rather than replaces

**Pending Decisions:**
- None

## Work In Progress

**Current Files:**
- N/A (just completed ACS installation)

**Mental Model:**
Site is stable and in maintenance mode. Content updates happen via JSON files. ACS now provides session tracking for future development work.

**Next Specific Action:**
When starting a new task, use TodoWrite to track it, then /save at end of session.

## Recent Accomplishments

**Last Session (2026-01-06):**
- Installed AI Context System v4.0.2
- Created context/ folder with core documentation
- Customized CONTEXT.md for project specifics

- `context/STATUS.md` - This file (current state)
- `context/DECISIONS.md` - Decision log

## Next Session

**Priority 1:** Continue with whatever task is needed
**Priority 2:** Run /code-review if wanting site audit
