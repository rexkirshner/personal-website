## Current Phase

**Phase:** Maintenance / Active Development
**Started:** Ongoing
**Target:** N/A (personal project, continuous updates)

**Focus:** Content updates and occasional feature additions. ACS now provides session continuity.

## Active Tasks

**In Progress:**
- [ ] QA testing ACS v5.0.0 commands (testing /save now - final command)

**Completed Recently:**
- [x] Upgrade to ACS v5.0.0 (with manual component download workaround)
- [x] Test /review-context - documented 5 feedback entries
- [x] Test /code-review agent-based system - 6 specialists ran in parallel
- [x] Test /save-full - documented 6 feedback entries
- [x] Test /validate-context - documented 6 feedback entries (found CRITICAL bug)
- [x] Generate first audit report (audit-01.json, audit-01.md)
- [x] Document 33 QA feedback entries in context-feedback.md

**Next Up:**
- [ ] Push commits to origin (after user approval)
- [ ] Submit QA feedback to ACS developers

## Blockers & Decisions

**Current Blockers:**
- None

**Recent Decisions:**
- **Keep CLAUDE.md at root:** Auto-loaded by Claude Code, serves as primary reference (D005)
- **Migrate tasks/todo.md content:** Extract decisions to DECISIONS.md, history to SESSIONS.md (D006)
- **Supplement don't replace:** ACS adds session state layer without duplicating CLAUDE.md

**Pending Decisions:**
- None

## Work In Progress

**Current Files:**
- `context/context-feedback.md` - 33 QA feedback entries
- `docs/audits/audit-01.{json,md}` - First audit report
- `.claude/cache/codebase-context.json` - Scanner cache

**Mental Model:**
ACS v5.0.0 agent-based architecture:
- Agents are specifications (not executable code)
- AI must implement scanning/review logic based on specs
- Agent contracts declare applicability via JSON
- Use Task tool for parallel specialist execution

**Next Specific Action:**
Push commits to origin after user approval.

## Recent Accomplishments

**Session 4 (2026-01-14):**
- Upgraded to ACS v5.0.0 (discovered and worked around installer bug)
- Tested all 5 commands: /review-context, /code-review, /save-full, /validate-context, /save
- Generated first audit report: Grade A, 8 low-severity findings
- Documented 33 QA feedback entries for ACS developers
- Found CRITICAL bug: validate-context.sh has outdated command names

**Key Files Created/Modified:**
- `.claude/agents/*.md` - 12 specialist agent files
- `.claude/schemas/*.json` - 7 JSON schema files
- `.claude/cache/codebase-context.json` - Scanner cache
- `docs/audits/audit-01.{json,md}` - First audit report
- `context/context-feedback.md` - 33 QA entries

**Git Status:**
- 6 commits ahead of origin (QA testing commits)
- No uncommitted changes

## Next Session

**Priority 1:** Push commits to origin (6 commits, requires user approval)
**Priority 2:** Submit QA feedback to ACS developers
**Priority 3:** Resume normal website maintenance

**Context Notes:**
ACS v5.0.0 QA testing COMPLETE. All 5 commands tested. Major findings: installer missing components (fixed manually), /code-review lacks execution instructions, validate-context.sh has outdated command names. 33 feedback entries documented for ACS developers.
