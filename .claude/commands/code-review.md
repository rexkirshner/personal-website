---

# /code-review Command

Master orchestrator for modular code reviews. Select one or more specialized audits to run, or run a comprehensive review covering all areas.

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **NEVER make code changes during review** - This is analysis only
2. **Take your time** - No rushing, no time pressure
3. **Use specialized commands** - Each audit type has its own detailed command
4. **Aggregate results** - Combine findings into a unified summary

## Audit Discovery

**Before showing the menu, discover all available audits:**

```bash
# Step 1: Find all audit command files
ls .claude/commands/code-review-*.md 2>/dev/null | grep -v "code-review.md$"

# Step 2: Read custom audit definitions from config
jq '.audits.custom // []' context/.context-config.json 2>/dev/null

# Step 3: Read custom presets from config
jq '.audits.presets // {}' context/.context-config.json 2>/dev/null
```

The orchestrator automatically discovers:
- **Built-in audits**: The 8 core audits included with the system
- **Custom audits**: Any `code-review-{name}.md` files in `.claude/commands/`
- **Custom presets**: Groupings defined in `context/.context-config.json`

## Built-in Audit Types

| Audit | Command | Description | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Security | `/code-review-security` | OWASP Top 10, auth, injection, XSS | Before production, after auth changes |
| Performance | `/code-review-performance` | Core Web Vitals, bundle, runtime | Before launch, after major features |
| Accessibility | `/code-review-accessibility` | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance | Before public launch, after UI changes |
| SEO | `/code-review-seo` | Metadata, structured data, crawlability | Public web apps, content sites |
| Database | `/code-review-database` | N+1, indexes, query optimization | After schema changes, slow queries |
| Infrastructure | `/code-review-infrastructure` | Serverless costs, caching, builds | Monthly cost reviews, scaling prep |
| TypeScript | `/code-review-typescript` | Type safety, strict mode, any usage | Before enabling strict, tech debt cleanup |
| Testing | `/code-review-testing` | Coverage, quality, CI integration | Before major releases, quality gates |

## Adding Custom Audits

### Step 1: Create the Command File

Create `.claude/commands/code-review-{name}.md`:

```markdown
---
name: code-review-{name}
description: Your audit description
---

# /code-review-{name} Command

[Your audit instructions here - follow the pattern of built-in audits]

## Checklist
- [ ] Check item 1
- [ ] Check item 2

## Report Template
[Define report structure]
```

### Step 2: Register in Config (Optional but Recommended)

Add to `context/.context-config.json`:

```json
{
  "audits": {
    "custom": [
      {
        "name": "api",
        "description": "REST API design and consistency audit",
        "weight": 1.0,
        "presets": ["backend", "all"]
      }
    ],
    "presets": {
      "api-focus": {
        "description": "API-centric review",
        "audits": ["security", "api", "testing"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Automatic Pickup

The orchestrator will automatically:
- Detect the new command file
- Add it to the interactive menu
- Include it in specified presets
- Apply the weight for grade calculations

**Unregistered audits** (command file exists but not in config) will:
- Appear in the menu with name derived from filename
- Use default weight of 1.0
- Only appear in `--all` preset

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Run single audit
/code-review-security

# Run multiple audits (this command)
/code-review --security --performance

# Run all audits
/code-review --all

# Run pre-production audits
/code-review --prelaunch
```

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Interactive Selection

When run without arguments, present an interactive menu built from discovered audits:

```
Code Review Orchestrator

Select audits to run (enter numbers separated by commas, or 'all'):

Built-in Audits:
1. Security      - OWASP Top 10, authentication, injection, XSS
2. Performance   - Core Web Vitals, bundle analysis, runtime
3. Accessibility - WCAG 2.1 AA, keyboard navigation, screen readers
4. SEO           - Metadata, structured data, crawlability
5. Database      - N+1 detection, indexes, query optimization
6. Infrastructure- Serverless costs, caching, build times
7. TypeScript    - Type safety, strict mode, any usage
8. Testing       - Coverage, test quality, CI integration

Custom Audits:                          <-- Only shown if custom audits exist
9. API           - REST API design and consistency audit

Presets:
A. All audits (comprehensive)
P. Pre-launch (Security + Performance + Accessibility + SEO)
B. Backend focus (Security + Database + Testing)
F. Frontend focus (Performance + Accessibility + SEO)
X. API-focus     - API-centric review   <-- Custom presets from config

Selection: >
```

**Dynamic Menu Building:**
1. Always show built-in audits (1-8)
2. Append custom audits discovered from `.claude/commands/code-review-*.md`
3. Show custom presets from `audits.presets` in config
4. Custom audits without config entries shown with name derived from filename

### Pattern 2: Command Line Arguments

Support these argument patterns:

```bash
# Individual audits (built-in)
/code-review --security
/code-review --performance --accessibility

# Custom audits (if registered)
/code-review --api
/code-review --security --api

# Built-in presets
/code-review --all          # Run all audits (built-in + custom)
/code-review --prelaunch    # Security, Performance, A11y, SEO
/code-review --backend      # Security, Database, Testing
/code-review --frontend     # Performance, Accessibility, SEO

# Custom presets (from config)
/code-review --api-focus    # Uses audits.presets.api-focus from config

# Platform-specific (passed to sub-commands)
/code-review --database --prisma
/code-review --infrastructure --vercel
```

**Argument parsing:**
- `--{audit-name}` runs that specific audit
- `--{preset-name}` runs all audits in that preset
- Unknown flags passed through to sub-commands (e.g., `--prisma`)

## Execution Steps

### Step 0: Parse Arguments or Show Menu

**If arguments provided:**
```
Code Review: Running selected audits

Selected: Security, Performance, Accessibility
Platform flags: --vercel (passed to infrastructure)

Starting in sequence...
```

**If no arguments:**
Show interactive menu (Pattern 1 above).

### Step 1: Run Selected Audits

For each selected audit, run the corresponding command:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Audit 1/3: Security
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[Run /code-review-security]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Audit 2/3: Performance
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[Run /code-review-performance]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Audit 3/3: Accessibility
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[Run /code-review-accessibility]
```

**Important:** Each sub-command saves its own report to `docs/audits/{type}-audit-NN.md`.

### Step 2: Generate Summary Report

After all audits complete, create a combined summary:

```bash
# Get next audit number for combined report
source scripts/common-functions.sh
NUM=$(get_next_audit_number "combined" "docs/audits")
REPORT_FILE="docs/audits/combined-audit-${NUM}.md"
```

**Summary report structure:**

```markdown
# Combined Audit Report (NN)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Repository | [name] |
| Auditor | Claude Code |
| Type | Combined |
| Audits Run | Security, Performance, Accessibility |
| Duration | [total time] |

## Preset Definitions

### --prelaunch (Pre-Production)

Essential audits before going live:
- Security (prevent vulnerabilities)
- Performance (ensure fast load times)
- Accessibility (comply with ADA/WCAG)
- SEO (search engine ready)

### --backend (Backend Focus)

For API and data-focused projects:
- Security (auth, injection, secrets)
- Database (queries, indexes, N+1)
- Testing (coverage, quality)

### --frontend (Frontend Focus)

For UI-heavy applications:
- Performance (Core Web Vitals)
- Accessibility (WCAG compliance)
- SEO (metadata, structure)

### --all (Comprehensive)

Run all audit types (built-in + custom). Best for:
- Major releases
- Annual reviews
- New team onboarding
- Quality certifications

### Custom Presets

Define in `context/.context-config.json`:

```json
{
  "audits": {
    "presets": {
      "api-focus": {
        "description": "API-centric review",
        "audits": ["security", "api", "testing"]
      },
      "quick": {
        "description": "Fast sanity check",
        "audits": ["security", "typescript"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use with: `/code-review --api-focus` or `/code-review --quick`

## Grading Calculation

Combined grade is weighted by severity:

**Built-in Audit Weights:**

| Audit | Weight | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Security | 1.5x | Critical for production |
| Performance | 1.0x | User experience |
| Accessibility | 1.2x | Legal compliance |
| SEO | 0.8x | Marketing value |
| Database | 1.0x | Data integrity |
| Infrastructure | 0.8x | Cost optimization |
| TypeScript | 0.8x | Maintainability |
| Testing | 1.0x | Quality assurance |

**Custom Audit Weights:**

Custom audits use the `weight` field from their config entry (default: 1.0):

```json
{
  "audits": {
    "custom": [
      { "name": "api", "weight": 1.2, ... }
    ]
  }
}
```

Formula: `(sum of weighted grades) / (sum of weights)`

## Error Handling

**If an audit fails:**
```
⚠️ Audit Error: Performance

Error: Could not run bundle analysis (webpack not configured)

Options:
1. Skip this audit and continue
2. Abort all audits
3. Retry with different options

Selection: >
```

**If audit takes too long:**
```
⚠️ Long Running: Database Audit

This audit is taking longer than expected.
Large codebases may take 10-15 minutes.

Options:
1. Continue waiting
2. Reduce scope (sample 50% of files)
3. Abort this audit

Selection: >
```

## When to Use This Command

**Use /code-review when:**
- You need multiple types of audits
- Preparing for a major release
- Want a comprehensive quality overview
- Setting quality baselines

**Use individual commands when:**
- You know exactly what audit you need
- Focused on one area (e.g., just security)
- Following up on specific findings
- Time is limited

## Migration from v3.x

If you previously used the monolithic `/code-review`:

| Old Behavior | New Approach |
|--------------|--------------|
| Single long report | Multiple focused reports + summary |
| artifacts/code-reviews/ | docs/audits/ |
| session-N-review.md | {type}-audit-NN.md |
| One checklist file | Built into each command |

The new system provides:
- More focused, actionable reports
- Better organization by audit type
- Easier to re-run specific audits
- Clearer remediation paths
